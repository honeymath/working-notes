[AI Runaway Is Not a Model Problem — It’s a Collapse of System Boundaries](posts/2026-01-04-ai-reasoning-english.md) [2026-01-04]
> In 2023, I began building my own AI agents. I thought I was using “advanced AI”—but quickly realized I was spending my time correcting an apprentice making elementary mistakes. From that moment on, one conclusion was clear: I should never let such systems send emails or execute commands.

> The problem is not capability—it is architecture. When language, reasoning, and execution are collapsed into a single layer, failure becomes inevitable. We have succumbed to what I call linguistic centralism: the belief that because an LLM can speak fluently, it can also reason and act. This is a category error. Language is a carrier, not cognition itself.

## About me

I’m Qirui Li. I’ve been writing code for over twenty years, and I’m trained as a mathematician, with a background in number theory and algebraic geometry.

I want to build my own AI by hand, but reality has repeatedly pushed back. What I write here comes from practice and failure notes, meant to avoid walking the same detours again and again.

Since AI technologies became widely used in 2023, I have watched social enthusiasm, misunderstanding, and hesitation—and how those misunderstandings, in turn, reshape reality. The absurdity of this process has driven me to record what I observe.

Many things look perfectly reasonable on the surface, yet feel deeply wrong when examined with basic common sense.
